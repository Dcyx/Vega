## Vega
Where are we flying to? We will go to the pier to get some french fries.

### Config
Vega will load config_private.ini information to call openai api. \
You should `cp config.ini config_private.ini` which is ignored to prevent leakage of personal 
information, and set your own openai api key & api base.
